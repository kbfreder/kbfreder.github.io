    "## Background\n",
    "Week 1 of the Metis Data Science Bootcamp is in the books! Our first project was a group one, in which we were tasked with mining NYC MTA Turnstile data to recommend optimal deployment of a Tech organization's volunteers. The organization wished to acquire mailing list sign-ups, promote their upcoming gala, and solicit potential donors. We were free to use other datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Team Members\n",
    "\n",
    "I need to start off by recognizing my team: Brenner Heintz, Hiranya Kumar, and Luke Tibbott. Our collective ideas, feedback, and efforts made a better final product than I would have been able to produce on my own. It was a pleasure to work with them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "- [MTA Turnstile Data](http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html)\n",
    "- Census data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tools:\n",
    "- Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn\n",
    "- Google API\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach\n",
    "Select top stations based on:\n",
    "- Traffic volume: a high-volume station means interacting with more people\n",
    "- Commuter \"fingerprint\": tourists are less likely to attend the Gala (and donate) than native New Yorkers.\n",
    "- Proximity to high-income residents: people with more disposable income are more likely to donate. "

A scan of the dataframe revealed an issue with the naming of the 'EXITS' column (it contained extra whitespace -- easily removed with `str.strip()`. This may seem like a small detail, but I mention it because **review of imported data is an essential part of data munging**. \n",
