    "### Motivation\n",
    "Some datasets are simple: they're entirely comprised of numeric features that all need to be scaled. Or maybe there are a few Categorical columns and your model doesn't require scaling of the numerical features. Rejoice, for your preprocessing will be easy.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what if you have a diverse dataset, or your preprocessing needs are more complex, or you want to preprocess your training and test data with a single line of code: this calls for exploiting scikit-learn's many preprocessing and pipeline functions. This blog post examines how (and when) to use `Pipeline` (or `make_pipeline`), `ColumnTransformer`, `FunctionTransformer`, and `FeatureUnion` to create custom transformation pipelines. "

    "\n",
    "- Numerical\n",
    "- Categorical - two flavors:\n",
    "  - value could be 1 of several (ex: 'acid', or 'base')\n",
    "  - value could be 1 *or more* of several (ex: 'protein, nucleic acid', or 'tissue')\n",
    "- Boolean\n",
    "  - 1 = True, 0 = False\n",
    "- Engineered Features \n",
    "   - mathematical combinations of two or more other columns\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, I wanted to test out Logistic Regression, tree-based models (Gradient Boosting Decision Trees), and CatBoost. Each required different preprocessing, but there were transformers in common between them. I opted to build up my pipelines using a \"unit\" approach. This made the final pipeline creation facile and flexible."

    "In summary, we've created 3 different pipelines, built the same \"units\" or base transformers. Creating small units separately and subsequently combining them in different ways allows for flexibility and efficiency. Defining custom transformer classes and functions expands the functionality of scikit-learn's builtin capabilities. `ColumnTransformer`, `FeatureUnion`, `FunctionTransformer`, and of course, `Pipeline` are powerful tools in developing custom preprocessors.
